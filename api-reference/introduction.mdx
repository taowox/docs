## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

<Card title="Plant Store Endpoints" icon="leaf" href="https://github.com/mintlify/starter/blob/main/api-reference/openapi.json">
  View the OpenAPI specification file
</Card>

<CodeGroup>

``` filename
// add code here
```


``` File 2
```

</CodeGroup>

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
